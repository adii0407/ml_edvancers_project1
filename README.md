 Problem statement  :- Flagging a property as possibly junk before hand can help businesses prioritise their efforts and focus them on the more probable successes rather than bogged down with the weight ofunsaleable portfolio . Task here was to build a predictive model for predicting whether a property should be marked as junk on the basis of listing details and preliminary assessment details. 
 
my solution :- In this project by making use of data from such past operations where many properties were found to be junk after their purchase for renovations.Predicted if a property is going to be unfit using its listing details and other features which were part of first preliminary assessment.
